## System Architecture Decisions

### 1. Microservices vs Monolithic
**Decision**: Started with a monolithic architecture for simplicity and rapid development
**Rationale**: 
- Easier to develop and deploy initially
- Can be split into microservices later as the application grows
- Reduces complexity for the MVP phase

### 2. Database Choice
**Decision**: PostgreSQL for structured data, ChromaDB for vector storage
**Rationale**:
- PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance and complex queries
- ChromaDB is purpose-built for vector similarity search
- Separation of concerns between structured and vector data

### 3. File Storage
**Decision**: Local file system with option for cloud storage
**Rationale**:
- Simple setup for development
- Can easily migrate to S3 or similar cloud storage
- Maintains file metadata in database for efficient querying

### 4. Authentication Strategy
**Decision**: Simplified authentication for MVP, ready for JWT implementation
**Rationale**:
- Focus on core functionality first
- Easy to add proper authentication later
- Reduces development complexity

## Performance Optimizations

### Backend Optimizations
1. **Background Processing**: Document processing runs asynchronously
2. **Connection Pooling**: Database connections are pooled for efficiency
3. **Chunking Strategy**: Large documents are split into optimal chunks
4. **Caching**: Vector embeddings are cached to avoid recomputation

### Frontend Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading**: Components load on demand
2. **Debounced Search**: Reduces API calls during typing
3. **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately for better UX
4. **Virtual Scrolling**: Efficient rendering of large lists

## Error Handling & Reliability
